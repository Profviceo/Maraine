A school Management system built from scratch with HTML, CSS and OOP PHP. My first PHP based project.

This project is intented for schools who want to make their workflow less stressful with a system that allows lecturers to assign assignments to students and also
allows for retrieving and submission from the students end.
A ticketing system was also integrated for submission of issues
