# Maraine
A school Management system built from scratch with HTML, CSS and OOP PHP. My first PHP based project.

This project is intented for schools who want to make their workflow less stressful with a system that allows lecturers to assign assignments to students and also
allows for retrieving and submission from the students end.
A ticketing system was also integrated for submission of issues

If you are looking to setup this on your local environment, you need to to have an apache server running on your environment which you can get using either Xampp or Mamp. It can also be used  on a live server that supports PHP.

For  steps on how to set the project up on your local environment, see the "Db-setup" folder and open the readme.txt file.
